Project 6 requires building an Express server that supports all four main HTTP verbs: GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE, with routes handling JSON requests and responses, including error handling and 404 support. The server maintains an in-memory array of objects updated via these routes. The project also includes client files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) served statically and interacting with the server. You must use minimal AI for the server code and document your work with a PDF including app description, AI prompts, and screenshots of the app, server console, and GitHub repo. The project focuses on full CRUD functionality and proper REST API design.
